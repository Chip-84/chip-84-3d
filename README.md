# Chip-84 3D
This is a port of my CHIP-8/SCHIP-8 interpreter, [Chip-84](https://github.com/ckosmic/chip-84) for the TI-84 Plus CE to Unity.  Chip-84 3D features many different viewing modes such as an old CRT TV, a hologram, a road sign, graph paper, and more.  This plays most if not all CHIP-8 and Super Chip-8 games.
